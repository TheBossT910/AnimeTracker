A simple iOS app to help you track anime you're watching or planning to watch.  

## Current Features

## Currently Implementing

- Weekly anime release calendar (This is the main feature of the app)

  - This feature was previously avaliable before migrating to Firebase, but wasn't implemented fully

## Future Plans (In No Particular Order)

- Sync to Google Calendar
- View animes by genre
- Search for animes
- Episode progress tracking (check off which episodes you have watched) (in the Schedule view)
- Integration with anime databases like MyAnimeList or AniList
- Add links to streaming services (in the details view)
- AI or ML powered anime recommendations, and anime episode recaps
- "Most watched" and "currently watching" leaderboard (new "leaderboards" view?)
- Better UI/UX

## Next Steps (Potential Future Extensions of This Project)
- iPadOS and MacOS version of app
- Chrome extension that syncs with the app, allowing automatic tracking of which shows a user has watched
- Android App (React Native? Flutter? Android Native?)
- Website (NextJS + React + Tailwind CSS?)
