- "Most watched" and "currently watching" leaderboard (new "leaderboards" view?)
- Better UI/UX

## Next Steps (Potential Future Extensions of This Project)

- Chrome extension that syncs with the app, allowing automatic tracking of which shows a user has watched
- Android App (React Native? Flutter? Android Native?)
- Website (NextJS + React + Tailwind CSS?)
